# Implementation of JLox

Following the book [**Crafting Interpreters**](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This contains the `Java` and `C` implemetations as well as answers to the challenges presented at the end of each chatper ðŸ˜„

## Java

### Prerequisites

* Made using [VSCode Extensions](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
* I am on macOS, so I installed `openjdk` through `brew install openjdk`.
* It is then linked through `CMD+Shift+P > Download, install and use JDK`.

### Compiling
* Compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default. This is in the `.gitignore`.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
